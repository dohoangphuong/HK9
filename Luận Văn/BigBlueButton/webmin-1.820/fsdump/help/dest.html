<header>Backup to</header>

This can either be the path to a file to which the backup will be written,
the path to a tape drive device (like <tt>/dev/st0</tt>), or a file or device
on a remote host. Backups to a remote system are done via the SSH protocol,
or optionally the older insecure RSH protocol. <p>

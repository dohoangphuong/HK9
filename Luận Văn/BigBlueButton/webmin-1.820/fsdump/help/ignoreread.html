<header>Ignore read errors on files?</header>

When this option is set to <b>Yes</b>, any errors reading files that should
be included in the backup will be ignored. It is useful for skipping the 
usually useless error <i>file changed as we read it</i> , but may mask 
permission or file corruption problems. <p>

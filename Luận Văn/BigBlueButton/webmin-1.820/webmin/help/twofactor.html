<header>Two-Factor Authentication</header>

Two-factor authentication can be used to add an extra layer of security
to a Webmin account, as well as the regular username and password. When enabled,
a user will need to provide an extra authentication token which typically
comes from a smartphone app, hardware OTP generator or SMS. <p>

This page allows you to select an authentication provider for Webmin users
on your system. Once enabled, each user can then enroll for two-factor
in the <b>Webmin Users</b> module. The available two-factor providers are :

<dl>

<dt><b>Authy</b>
<dd>This is a commercial service that provides a smartphone app and website
    for managing two-factor users. Each user must create an account on Authy's
    website and link it to their smartphone. <p>

<dt><b>Google Authenticator</b>
<dd>This is a smartphone app that implements the standard TOPT protocol. Each
    user must scan a QR code using the app to link their tokens with the
    Webmin server. <p>
